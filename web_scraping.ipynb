              "  'The amount of angry reactive negative reviews is out of hand down here. The store page clearly states this game is missing features and has plenty of bugs as it is in and alpha state.TL;DR           Game has problems mostly from minor teething issues turning into full blown growing pains on launch. Devs know about them and are actively working to fix. I\\'d recommend you stay away for the time being unless you\\'re desperate to be playing this right now.For what it\\'s worth, I\\'m enjoying my time with the game despite the issues.\"Building is broken, and that ruins the game.\"           I agree most with this, and it\\'s a large part of why I\\'m negatively reviewing. However, the developers know and are working on it. I\\'m gonna sound like a broken record after this: This is an Early Access game. They are not meant to be 100% polished and finished products.\"I can\\'t refuel my ship\" is an issue because the tutorials barely cover anything.           You can refuel the propellant for your ship at a refueling center. You have 4 extra fuel rods on your ship you can swap in your generator. They are kinda far down the tech tree to craft, but they are dirt cheap in the Auction House. Found all this out in less than a minute through asking in chat. I\\'ve seen people say that 1,800 credits is expensive. That is literally a minutes worth of work at most.\"Mining is broken\"           While I know a bunch of people are having this issue, I haven\\'t had it happen once myself. This I think is due to the servers being a burdened from the launch. Some people have said turning off auto collect and turning it back on helps.

              "  \"*Stargrind*I have 1500 hours in the closed alpha version of the game, here is your proof https://i.imgur.com/21T3sRj.png. At the current time I cannot recommend this game for the average player. If you are not part of a faction or group you will be spending endless hours grinding to just begin. I am part of Empire, a dev faction, a large faction, I have many people at my disposal to help with the many problems encountered and you will find many problems. Even for a seasoned player Im struggling with the poorly described new systems. A new player is going to feel so lost on the horrible default keyboard controls let alone what the gameplay really requires. Im glad I am in a large faction because my grind will be days compared to a solo player's weeks. The main grind in SB right now is research points for items. Prepare to free up your schedule; in starbase a one hour activity will always take several hours. Be aware to climb the progression tree, a new system that was never in ca, you will need: a huge amount of surplus ore for construction starting with a tiny ship, a large chunk of your free day to slowly craft items for points as you stand there doing nothing, and slowly acquiring research as you build things in massive bulk to collect small drops of points. In a faction, players bring ore to me so I can build ships, thus no wasted time spent mining. Allowing me to quickly gain research, but even a full day of crafting endless items will not get you far in the tech free. With this in mind, for a solo player you have to mine the ore, travel back and forth playing RNG for the ore you want, refuel your ships, stockpile ore, cover expenses, then build something with your work to gain research points to hopefully unlock something useful. You see I dont have to do any of that, everything is brought to me, and even I am still spending a full day not getting far into the tech tree. So good luck solo players it will be painful as you do all of this yourself...  The research element is like a massive hurdle to overcome. When this game ages, some factions will become established, some months or years down the road. The people who already have spent the days/months unlocking the tech tree with the most tech knowledge will have an infinitely huge advantage over new players, new factions, or those who lagged behind since the start of live. These players beyond the hurdle will dictate the economy and supply chain; everyone else is just forced to play by their terms. This is really something that kills games and more so pvp games. Instead of equal starting ground without a tech tree; like CA was carried out. We have a massive grind wall to establish a huge divide between the playerbase. After this grind hurdle its just the same issue as in CA. Everyone is insanely rich and everything comes with an insanely inflated price tag. Which is likely to force new players to build everything manually to afford things.I have 1500 hours in the game and I cannot recommend you play this game solo. Find a faction, find a group, find anyone to help you play because you cannot succeed in this game without a ton of hand holding to help you along the way. I love stargrind, I just wish the devs would have listened to our feedback a little more closely. Now Im worried it will bomb in the reviews like it has been and will fizzle out. The devs just released the game without enough content in empty space and too many issues. We tried to tell them...my suggestions for the game to improve-remove the progression system or make it very easy to unlock items. do something like touching an unknown item will teach you how to build it. these are cybernetic beings after all with magical abilities to levitate items like jedi.-a big fat skip tutorial button on screen that does not bug out preventing you from joining groups. like the issue that occurs if you use the current skip function in the settings. when skipping all the tutorial items are placed in your station inventory; or just provide all the items needed for the tutorial instead of forcing players to spend up to infinite time just trying to find things in space. the tutorial itself is an annoying grind the moment we get the ship needing to find ores. go back to the old tutorial format where we walk from work station to work station. this new tutorial was never tested in CA and it is painfully bad. up to not informing new players they need to replace fuel roads in their generator, which is basic knowledge...-actually follow the roadmap unlike in ca where it was just whenever released. in ca there was a roadmap sure. but items listed were never released in the order shown, if at all.-either remove the player auction house or only allow players to charge up to a predetermined value of an item. forcing players to sell lower than the default value to make sales. otherwise we will soon have hyperinflation as was already seen in ca!-overall reducing everything grind based in this game. any little thing that takes significant amounts of time player time. this is suppose to be a space building sandbox. not a grindbox. current grind elements: building a ship, travel time thanks to slow max speed with no alternatives to surpass the max speed using performance items, mining ore with either pickax or laser, crafting time of items, transfer all that transfers most inventory items instead of all, lack of hud indication for insurance points on a station, shooting firearms because they are all flawed in someway to stretch out time to kill with only two real meta pvp choices, and of course the horrible progression system I wish removed.my biggest current complaint?it has to be the bugs, in ca the devs always kept us months or even years from their current game version. if they had just let us test the version closer to release these bugs could have been found before sales hit. like the inventory bug, drop an item into space, and that item remains in the inventory unusable forcing you to relog to fix it. This bug was a day f'ing one bug in CA that was patched long ago. like how did no one notice this for live in the dev testing...I will update this review as the months roll by. I hope to change it into a positive review someday.\"],\n",

The good:- 10.000 players in the same solarsystem on day2. Sometimes you see a ship rubberband and go back a few meters but I\\'ve never had any rubberbanding issues on my ship or during interactions. - True MMORPG: I found players flying around 40km in the asteroid belt away from any stations. - Very chill mining experience. You fly out about 20km and casually mine asteroids by hand. It\\'s a very satisfying experience. - Good player market. You find high and low prices for ores. When you can craft something you can make some big gains. Ofcourse this changes as the game gets updated. - Slow progress. Not a game you can binge and finish in a long weekend. This is a long-term MMORPG experience. - Big clan war mechanics. I\\'ve not seen any PVP action but the potential of big epic ship conflics is huge. You can actually attack starbases and capital ships. Good ship-engineers will win clanwars in this game. - Factory building. I\\'ve not experienced this part but this is partly \"factorio\" style gameplay. - Ship designing, building, selling- Starbase designing & building- Simplified YOLOL programming means you can enhance the performance of your ships or your clans ships if you have the brains and the patience. - You program floppydisks you can trade. A refreshing idea to trade floppydisks you plug into someone elses ship to gain the functionality you programmed on it.   - A detailed roadmap with upcoming features is available in the Starbase discord announcement channel.The bad: - Quite a few horrible bugs right now. The Devs have been online all weekend hotfixing issues. The support they are providing is top notch. The conclusion:One of the better EarlyAccess game launches I\\'ve seen in a long time. Everything seems to work quite well having 10.000 people online. There are some major bugs to fix like the \\'easybuild\\' snapping grid that disappears after editing the ship 3 times. Hopefully the mixed review people will leave and let us have an absolutely refreshing space MMORPG experience we\\'ve been waiting for. If you can handle having your front teeth handed to you because your ship vanished due to a bug or your fuel rods being empty instead of full due to a bug, or building issues, then go ahead and join. If you can\\'t deal with the bugs, I\\'d recommend waiting a couple weeks until the biggest problems are hotfixed.'],\n",

But firstly I will say I'm bad at both Mini Metro and this game, so take this opinion from someone who is happy to hit 1200 passengers on a map and not much else.Firstly I think I like Motorways better than Metro. Something about how the cars move around and the road network expands feels better compared to managing single trains. I don't have a solid grasp on exactly why that is but I'm having a blast and the whole thing feels great.That said I do feel like Motorways is more monotone than Metro. I'm not having to adapt my strategy based on spawns anywhere near as much as in Metro and every game is pretty much me just doing my thing.  Motorways very rarely if ever forces me to rethink large parts of my network with a couple inconvenient spawn and often I can't think of much I would do differently anyway. In Metro I was constantly questioning my whole network and often had to redo things because of spawns. So yeah the curveballs are just not as meaningful here and there is way less to micromanage as well. You do have to move your motorways around sometimes but that is about it.So yeah IMO Motorways is significantly more one-note than Metro but nonetheless feels fantastic and I'm having a blast playing it. And again I'm bad so very much possible that's all just wrong.EDIT: I should add everything about the visuals/audio/gameplay of Motorways is wonderful. It is smooth and beautiful and just functions in a flawless manner. It is polished to the finest detail to a great effect and I have no real complaints. Metro was smooth in it's own right but Motorways manages  to take that style to a whole another level. EDIT: and yeah a creative mode where we could stop spawns/move shops around/prevent failure would be great just to create fancy cities :)\"],\n",

The racing is fun and close when difficulty is tunes, and I enjoy the act of just driving around in this (though some of the kerbs can get knotted).Big issue is the VIP pass thing, and the attitude it shows. It's even more egregious than F1 2020 - it's front and centre, with some more categories of items to dilute your experience further. By default there are very limited customisation options (even compared with F1 2020), so you might be even more tempted to part with an extra £9 or so just to get the VIP pass. On top of the £55 already spent, with EAs regional pricing making it far more expensive in some areas. That's just grubby. I'm fine with XP based unlocks, but paying for additional cosmetic items in a game like this is predatory and exploitative.Don't reward them for this. Get the game if you feel the price is worth it for the story mode and the coop career mode, and you are fortunate enough to have the disposable income.

This isn\\'t some massive in depth RPG and the only comparison to cyberpunk 2077 is a loose similarity in aesthetic and the ability to equip augmentations.What it is though is a standard Third person, Isometric shooter much like the Sony exclusive Dead Nation (Only one that comes to mind right now but there\\'s alot of similar games, the weighty feel of the player character really reminds me of that one).I\\'m enjoying the world, the small details and - as a fan of isometric shooters - the combat, which again, if you\\'re a  fan of iso-shooters you\\'ll feel at home here. You collect new weapons, upgrade em, upgrade your clothes - or don\\'t bother and just pick what looks cool, ♥♥♥♥ it man - and mow down countless enemies to a sweet retro-cyberpunk soundtrack. This game is sick.My only complaint\\'s are that:- The map is ♥♥♥♥♥♥\\' Garbage, not really sure where I\\'m going - EVER. There is an option to display a route to your next objective but good luck navigating without the use of that feature, or without a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ Nepalese sherpa. Adding a key to the map would be a much appreciated edition to the game.- I wish I could zoom the camera in a lil bit, just makes things easier to describe.Okay so I guess that\\'s actually all I have to complain about, I got this at a hella discount for 15Moneys and I\\'m sure I\\'ll have more complaints with time but for 15Moneys, this game is pretty epic.Also I\\'m drunk so ignore me, maybe this game is ♥♥♥♥. 400/40: good game'],\n",

              "  'I don\\'t want to review bomb this game. However I do want to point out some shortcomings as I see it. The comparisons between this and Diablo are improper. It has an entirely different multiplayer setup. The loot isn\\'t randomized and it\\'s classless. The classless aspect is fine, but the  loot being the same for each player has a couple negative consequences. If the idea is to differentiate yourself from your companions, you\\'ll find that unfortunately despite different \"builds\" there will be moments where the optimized and best equipment is a geared towards certain playstyles. You\\'ll have to accept lower grade equipment if you want to continue differentiating yourself from your companions. The impression I get is this is a single player game with multiplayer added in. One way to correct this is more equipment, more often that covers more play styles, so you have more choices earlier on. Because of the lack of random loot, it feels like you\\'re waiting for your time to shine. You could play diablo for months. I played this for a day and am almost done with it. I wouldn\\'t feel the need to replay it. There\\'s little incentive to return or hunt mobs to find gear, there\\'s no real loot generation and everything you find is sold as a duplicate. Even with a NG+ mode and higher tier difficulty, without the random loot generation there\\'s no end game. It\\'s a singleplayer one shot campaign masquerading as some deep 4 player experience.The world is beautiful, but many times your exploration isn\\'t reinforced. It would have been beneficial for the dev team to review the map, and throw down a few chests in corners and ice containers in locations where you might explore. It\\'s disappointing to wander a location and find nothing but dead ends.The way that side quests operate currently is confusing and should be fixed, simply because the level requirement listed isn\\'t accurate. You might have a really low level side quest, but have to battle through high level dangerous mobs to get to certain points. Worse still, once you get there you find that the area hasn\\'t been generated yet because you haven\\'t gone far enough in the main quest to unlock it. This has happened multiple times. I would say the way to correct this is to have side quest NPCs unlock and show visibly on the map when you\\'ve completed far enough in the main quest to actually complete the quest. The uCred economy feels flawed. There are times where you feel rich but theres nothing to buy. There isn\\'t an economy sink to pour it into. A solution here would be to offer conversion from the uCred economy to the component economy at a high ucred to component ratio.The hacker playstyle doesn\\'t seem fleshed out enough in the early game, you\\'ll run into some really cool NPCs that throw down a lot of black ice and seem to have really unique playstyles, but a couple hours in and I\\'m not quite able to emulate that... So the negative is that you can\\'t really build that class until you get the tools to do it. Edit: at the end game now - Doesn\\'t exist.There are bugs, a lot when dealing with co-op. At one point I wasn\\'t able to invite my teammate after a crash, we\\'d be stuck at the loading screen. I\\'d have to make it singleplayer, open it and then invite and it seemed to work. I am enjoying the game, but I can\\'t help but \"wish\" that certain design decisions weren\\'t made, and that so many consolations were made to release. I will support the devs and this game, but I\\'m not sure that they can see the forest through the trees here and if this will ever reach the promised lands. It\\'s bittersweet, because in my opinion this game is such a huge undertaking.... it feels like a game that was made by a big budget studio with hundreds of developers.Update: Co-op friend lost entire inventory. Game is not ready for prime time. Should be considered EA. Why am I giving this game a pass?Bugs: Too many to name in co-op. Floor not appearing. Random disconnects. Freezes. Crashing. Double mobs and boss spawning. Many side quests broken. Random graphical issues.Combat is good, but the items and loot is not satisfying in 4 player co-op. Should have released it single-player because there isn\\'t enough content. Lots of poor design decisions, real lack of QoL. Navigation and walking/dashing everywhere + taxi gets boring(walking is probably 50% of gametime, which could be fun but exploration is lackluster even though environment is good). Lore rips off a lot of cyberpunk lore, doesn\\'t really differentiate itself. Indents was a good idea though.I gave them a pass earlier but realize that based on many of the design decisions they missed the point. The RPG system is extremely weak, the reward system seems broken. A little more time in the oven with more Q/A and player feedback and this game could have been a smash hit. Instead it\\'s a visually stunning game that will soon be forgotten. Simply put... this is an Early Access title and should have been marketed as such.If the time had been taken to reverse course on a couple design decisions this game could have sold millions of copies. In 2021, I\\'m starting to appreciate when video games just work... Shouldn\\'t be a coin toss. Should have really worked with more players and not content creators to help hone in the vision here. Lots of talent and hard work was wasted on a one shot.'],\n",

              "  'Two important points to start with (at 7h of gameplay):1. this is not a Diablo-like ARPG with random loot and procedurally generated dungeons. This is a story-based fixed-world twin-stick shooter with RPG elements (as in, your character has stats, but doesn\\'t have a choice). And \"fixed world\" means that there is very little replayability potential. I hope I\\'m proven wrong by the time I finish it, but right now it seems like a one-playthrough game2. there are bugs, sometimes game-breaking (quest target enemies didn\\'t spawn for me on one of the story quests), there are some important QoL features missing (sprint, please?), and UI could use some polish. Devs have promised support and patches, looking forward to itNow, to the good parts:1. this game is a damn eye candy. The world is huge, full of amazing little details, and is absolutely gorgeous. Fantastic level design, lighting, camera angles: 10/10 GOTY on graphics alone2. shooting is fun and complex. While the early stages you are somewhat restricted in what kind of build your character can realistically have, by mid-game the possibilities grow by a lotUpdate (at 13h of gameplay):As I keep playing, my opinion of the game keeps going down. The graphic fidelity is still undeniably there, although endless high-fidelity drab corridors with very detailed crates in them are getting somewhat old, but apart from it there aren\\'t many areas for which I could give The Ascent praise. Sidequest design in particular is quite poor because you constantly get sent into locations that are either hard-locked behind main quest progression or are way above your level (looking at you, both stages of Anabolic Express quest). Navigation is bad because the map lacks detail (try finding a building that you don\\'t have a marker for), map markers don\\'t have height indication, and quests rarely tell you which fast travel location would be optimal to take. And loot system still doesn\\'t make any sense. Why does the concept of duplicate items even exist? Final update (after finishing the game):Overall, it\\'s a good game. The plot is solid, gunplay is decent, and you\\'ve heard it all about graphics already. Here\\'re a few tips to get the most out of the game:1. Use the damn taxi. Don\\'t hoard money.2. Use the damn cover. At a certain point kiting becomes too slow and too boring.3. Focus on the main mission. You can work on the sidequests later.P.S.: the alphanumeric code in armor name describes its resists. E-30 Something Something gives 30 points of (E)nergy armor, PF-40 Something Something gives 40-ish points of (P)hysical and (F)ire armor.'],\n",

Too many times the comparison gets drawn out because \"muh vikings craft!\" but they couldn\\'t be further apart.Tribes of Midgard is a roguelite game where you go on hourlong \"runs\" through a procedurally generated world that\\'s pretty extensively geared around large-group play. As a solo experience, it\\'s not the best. It feels lonely, and you always feel like you\\'re juggling too many things at once to keep them fully balanced. The game says it \"scales with player count\" but only in terms of boss HP and resources you collect per-node. The map size is static and always massive in scale, with everything you want to gather sprinkled throughout and no definite direction or guarantee you\\'ll find everything you need where you\\'re going. You will have a very difficult time scoping out the land and finding points of interest -- or even your objectives within the fierce time limit Saga Mode puts you in by yourself or even with one or two friends. Every time night falls, you stop and defend the village. Every time a Jotunn spawns, you stop and defend the village. Because you and potentially a few other people are all that\\'s there to do anything about the constantly-encroaching mechanics.However; in a large group, the game immediately opens up. In a server with plenty of friends or even just randos will immediately lighten the load. Suddenly you can have teams and roles. People specializing in certain duties. Some people will be dedicated to reinforcing the village and pushing back the night-raids. Some people will hunt down the Jotunn. Some will specialize into the weather-locked zones to gather rare materials for the entire group and distribute better gear to survive the approaching winter. Everyone has a job to fulfill and you\\'re all working towards a common goal in your own separate ways. And that\\'s where I think the game really shines, and where I believe it makes up for it\\'s rather unpleasant solo-experience.'],\n",

              "  \"The game is kind of different from the way its marketed in the steam page, but for what it is it's a great game. And what is that game? There are two modes in the game currently, Saga mode and Survival. Many of the reviews you will read here will be talking about the Saga mode. That is the current seasonal mode and it is more of a rogue-lite with permanent character upgrades after every run. These are often shorter faster paced games.Survival is the other longer term mode which is only unlocked after getting your account to level 3 from playing one or two Saga mode games. It's odd they're forcing people to play Saga mode to play Survival after but its not too hard to get there. This is a game that is much better playing with a group of coordinated friends, and I can't say much about experiencing random groups and people leaving mid-game but I can definitely see how that can be a problem. Overall this is an amazing experience if you get the chance to play with a group. Bugs are rare, annoyances are small, quality of life has been added everywhere since my experience with one of the previews. There's no premium battle-pass, there IS a premium currency for cosmetics. I would recommend it if you have friends or are willing to find a group to play with. I have not tried a solo run but I can see how fun it can be after a run or two where you learn what you need to do.\"],\n",

              "  \"Highly recommend...This is a really good CO-OP game to play with friends.  At it's heart it is a rogue-lite, but it mixes different elements from different genres and does it quite well. There's a bit of survival/crafting, tower defense, RPG, exploration and adventure.It's got quite a steep initial learning curve. But once you pass that, it really opens up and becomes quite fun, and it is very rewarding to play with a well co-ordinated group.So why so many negative reviews?  There's two main reasons. And it has to do with us (the consumer) misintrepting the game and it's features. Of course, the bad marketing doesn't help.1. Many people were expecting some kind of diablo-like quality action RPG which it is not (the combat is decent, but it definitely can be improved to have more depth). It doesn't help that it was marketed as an action RPG. If you are solely looking for a great action RPG, this is NOT it!2. There is a cash shop with micro-transactions and a battle bass. Many people see this and right away think it's P2W...However, the micro-transactions are all cosmetic only. They do NOT affect gameplay in any way. And the battle pass is free as well, as will future ones be. In addition, future content for the game is all being added for FREE. When you consider these things, the COSMETIC cash shop is more understandable. (Now if the devs start introducing NON-cosmetic items then yes we'd have a big problem).Also a side point - Some negative reviews are about the difficulty and  balance issues (especially souls, the in game currency). These are mostly invalid. By its very nature the game is supposed to be difficult, especially in the beginning (as most roguelites are). In order to succeed, it requires good teamwork, communication, planning and strategy...but is highly rewarding if you do these things well. As for balancing, there are small things I agree with that could use some work, but nothing game-breaking. As for the souls, this isn't really an issue after you discover and understand certain mechanics (which I will not spoil). TLDR;In conclusion, this game is pretty good and if you like CO-OP roguelikes/rogue-lites with a mix of survival/crafting, bit of adventure and exploration sprinkled in there with procedural generated worlds, you probably will like this. The negative reviews come mostly from different expectations and false assumptions...Of course, can this game be improved? Yes. The combat system can be improved and some other elements of the game can be balanced out and improved (like please give us multiple save files on SAGA mode for example...), but the devs are pretty involved and open to feedback so I'm feeling pretty optimistic this game will get even better than it is. For now, I strongly recommend this game as a highly rewarding CO-OP rogue-lite experience (especially considering it's only $20 and has a TON of replayability).Please upvote this so people can get a true sense of what this game is, and make an informed decision (especially amidst this rocky launch).\"],\n",

              "  'Only 63% of user reviews for Tribes of Midgard are positive and this is mostly justified. An overview of current reception:Between poor marketing, launch day server issues, an unexpected cash shop, season content, as well as simple sometimes janky mechanics, you\\'ve got the recipe for brewing a big batch of disappointment.With that said, there are a fair number of negative responses that are nothing more than the bandwagon effect. ToM fails to live up to the \"hype\" but, it is a solid game that would benefit from adjustments to get it up to par.General thoughts:The cell shaded graphics are pleasing to the eye, animations are decent for an indie title, sound is passable, and the gameplay loop, while not being a hit for everyone, is mostly solid in nature. ToM seems to take a little bit from multiple popular games in varying genres and meshes the mechanics together in an effective, albeit, simple way.The \"matches\" are short(1-2 hours) depending on the ability to adapt to the learning curve. Solo or co-op play with up to 10 players is pretty neat as well, although, implementation leaves a lot to be desired. Balance and progression is where ToM really falls short currently.Personal gripes and disappointments:Days are laughably quick and the number of tasks you need to accomplish early on is frustrating. Failure to progress quick enough in the first 3-4 days will lead to wiping as you progress, often wasting a fair chunk of time. It doesn\\'t help that failure is unforgiving. If your village is overrun and you do not get to the exit point quick enough you will be forced to forfeit almost all meaningful earned rewards. The potential set back can be irritating for those with limited time.In conclusion:Overall, I don\\'t believe Tribes of Midgard is that bad of a game. It\\'s merely suffering from an implied identity disorder and perhaps a lack of QA and balance testing before release. Given that it sees some much needed TLC from the developers, it could even be a great game. Is it worth buying? I think this is very much specific to taste. I am personally enjoying it but, I also realize the current state of the game and the content in general may not be for everyone. With that said, I do think it\\'s worth recommending as long as the buyer takes a broad look at what they do and do not enjoy before buying in.'],\n",

              "  'This is a negative review for now.tl;dr at the bottomThe game has potential but as it is now it feels as if the game hasn\\'t been tested, and I don\\'t mean in a \"It\\'s riddled with bugs\" kind of way, though it does have some bugs here and there, luckily I haven\\'t experienced that many.The game is marketed to be played with UP TO 10 players, so far I\\'ve only played it solo and with one other person and here are my thoughts:Time:Whether you play solo or with people, the day\\'s last 10 minutes real time, this includes the day time, preparation time and night time, the night time takes up more and more time of the day the further you get into the game, up to the entire day being night on day 14 to 15 (this also seemed to last way longer than 10 minutes)Night is when your village gets attacked, and day is when you generaly go out to gather resources and discover  shrines, etc.The further in you get into the game the colder the map gets as wel, meaning that with out the right precautions , you won\\'t even be able to venture out without dying of cold. The village area seems to always be a comfortable temperature, so you won\\'t have to worry about freezing your toes off whilst fighting during the night.Resources:Playing alone or with people won\\'t change the amount of available resources, nor the amount needed for upgrades/crafting cost. This means that if you play solo you can rejoice as everything you find is yours to keep and use.. but with more people this does mean people can spread out and gather items a lot faster and in higher quantities in the limited time of day. Also everything costs souls, a lot of them. your weapons break quick and cost a lot to repair, especially later on. If you don\\'t have enough you are out of luck, there is no partial repair, and getting more without your weapons can be a challenge, especially as the days are getting shorter.Map:the map is procedurally generated you will usually have at least a starter biome nearby but higher level areas could also practically border your village or block you off from zones you need, as wel as going into the wrong direction might make you completely miss a biome with resources you need.Oh and water is a viking\\'s worst enemy it seems, simply wetting your pinky means instant death.one of the most infuriating things about this game is how when you dodge roll and your little toe touches the water the game decides you just rolled off into that river and instantly drowned.. or similair things with cliffs falling to your death.I\\'ve had points where my dodge animation stopped right before the water but the game still slid me off the side into the river making me lose all my souls. dodge rolling is also quite unpredicatable especially when using speed potions or other boosts(enrage or Eir Effigies) you should not roll as it will probably kill you.combat: When playing solo, enemies are fairly weak and easy to defeat at the start, requiring little effort and even the first Jötunn is fairly easy to defeat (their health seems to depend on which one spawns, ranging from 36k to 45k from what I\\'ve seen).When playing with atleast one other person enemies get stronger however they get quite a lot stronger, enemies that are easy solo might pose a bit of a challenge when with more players, unless you fight them together (though doing this mightnot be the best idea, as explained later) this also accounts for the Jötunn I\\'ve seen their health nearly double with just one additional player. This might not be much of a problem at earlier days but it does seem to pose a problem later.Experience(and quest/challenge kill counters):This must be one of the absolutely dumbest designs they made in the game. pretty much everything grants experience, from slaying enemies, to harvesting , finding shrines and upgrading village parts/villagers. This is fine, however how they implemented this is as followed.Upgrading and finding shrines is globally shared among all players, this is great, now we won\\'t have to discuss or wait/share upgrades so people don\\'t lag behind.Combat however, the player (OR NPC) who deals the last blow, gets all the exp you could be working your ass off to kill some enemies for a quest only to have npc\\'s deal the final blow to them because you either missed your shot or are still in your animation. i had a quest to kill 23 Helthings, and though there were plenty, it took me several ingame days because the only place (besides a certain Jötunn) they spawn is at the village at night, and the NPC\\'s there kept stealing my kills. This also means that if your quest asks you to kill a certain boss and a friend helps you and accidently lands the final blow, you can go look for another one of those bosses. now since they are a lot stronger when you play with other people. they become nearly impossible to solo.. meaning an increased risk of this happening.The season pass.Normally i have no issue with them, it gives you something to work for.BUT are you kidding me?!?!, adding game impacting items to a time limited season pass. These legendary tier unlockables (non-cosmetics) should be part of the normal challenges not part of a time limited event , if this was a variation/skin to a normally obtainable item I\\'d say fine, but this is just scuffy. Other than that it contains some nice cosmetics, some coins or other items to buy cosmetics with, Things I\\'d suggest.-Make the days longer, or don\\'t ramp up the extending of nights so quick, especially on solo play it makes the game impossible to the point it is just stressful, -Either lower the gear repair cost or increase the durability of gear by significant amounts.-Make biomes Less Random.Cheesy as it sounds. I\\'d suggest making it somewhat predictable as where you could most likely find a certain biome, colder regions? go north,  warmer regions go south? for all i care it\\'s not even deadset but simply an increased chance. I hate having to traverse half the map through frost areas and deserts to find a spawn of wolves, just so i can upgrade my axe to Tier 2.-change game impacting recipies in the season pass to the normal challenges-with increasing player count,  buff enemies less and increase the amount of enemies instead (with no change to their damage output) -make combat exp be shared in the vicinity.tl;dr-The game is clearly not designed to be played by only a very few people or even solo, as you simply don\\'t have the time to do the gathering and exploring you need, forcing you to make choices when you don\\'t have the luxury to make them.-Water is your worst enemy and means insta death, do not dodge roll anywhere near it, the same goes for cliffsides that end in nothingness or water.-The RNG can be really punishing, leaving you without Tier 2 resources anywhere near your base, requiring you to go through stronger areas and venture further when you get less and less time. -Combat & experience.Combat gets significantly harder the  more players are in the game, the scaling seems a bit rediculous especially for when you are playing with only one or 2 other people. combat experience and objectives don\\'t get shared, I\\'d expected a game built for team play to atleast share combat exp in the vicinity.-Season pass.Are you kidding me, adding game impacting items to a time limited season pass. These legendary tier unlockables (non-cosmetics) should be part of the normal challenges not part of a time limited event , if this was a variation/skin to a normally obtainable item I\\'d say fine, but this is just scuffy. Other than that.The game was clearly not ready to be released and requires a lot of balancing and testing. I do say it has a lot of potential and looks like it could be a fun game.the game seems fairly barren now in terms of what it could have but I am assuming they are still working on adding things (weapons/classes/maps/game modes ?)

The difference is Don't Starve at its heart is a survival game, you are tasked with surviving but all obstacles you face, can and eventually will, be beaten. Runs go from lasting minuets, to hours, to days and beyond. Somewhere in that the games stops feeling like a rogue-like, and more like a base builder. Tribes of Midgard feels like a rogue like at its heart. The game starts off as a challenge, and only gets harder. The game becomes easier at higher player counts, but if everyone is not pulling their weight, death is sure to come. At day 15 night becomes endless, and the base never stops being attacked. They're are only so many upgrades to be done to the base, and the final boss of the run is only ever a few hours away. When you add all of that up, you get a game that, with a few friends, leads to a few hours of great challenging fun, that has left me and my group of friends saying, lets have another run. From run to run you will be sure to be thinking on how to optimize gathering, resources and builds. Depth that is much appreciated for the flavor it adds to the core game-play loop. Progression with unlocking classes, and through the free battle pass is also a very nice touch.  Are there drawbacks sure, if you don't like rogue-likes the game is probably not for you. You will lose a lot. Matchmaking and difficulty scaling could be much improved on. I would love to have a friends only mode that did not just cap my party size at what ever my party size is going into the game so friends could join late.
